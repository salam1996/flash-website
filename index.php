			As long as I don’t fail any classes, I should be graduating this upcoming May.  After that, I’m starting a software engineering position right outside of Boston.  It’s funny that, somehow, I’ve made it through four years of college, stuck with my Computer Science major, and am now employed in a position that’ll apply my Computer Science knowledge!  Along with my major, I am minoring in Political Science and have completed my cluster in American Sign Language.  If time allowed it, I would be interested in minoring in ASL as well.  I have two Deaf relatives, and I wish I was better able to communicate with them, so I'm glad I was able to learn more about Deaf culture through my cluster.  In addition, I’m the first in my family to graduate high school (and subsequently the first in my family to graduate college), so it’s a weird shock to be earning a degree in a field I’ve felt (and still sometimes feel) inadequate in.  It's no secret that there are fewer women than men in computing, though I've learned of and found a community for myself.  It’s scary to imagine becoming a full-fledged adult.  Being at UR and away from my home in Queens, NY has definitely helped me gain the necessary knowledge and independence.  I’m ready, but hesitant, for what’s ahead.  <a href="http://midris2.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/csc174/lab01/www/">Find out more about Maisha.</a>

		I am from Eastern part of China, a city called Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. It is very close to Shanghai, 2 hours away by bullet train. I have an elder sister, who has been married. My brother-in-law is my life tutor, with whom I always share my concerns and worries. They have twin babies who are super cute and are in the stage of kindergarten. I am very happy they are going to come to my commencement this May. I am looking forward to travelling with them around the US together.  <a href="http://xding12.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/csc174/lab01/index.php">Find out more about Sharon.</a>

		<p> I am a senior at the University of Rochester majoring in Financial Economics with a minor in Business. Before transferring to the U of R a couple years ago, I was living in Austin, Texas. Most recently, I was working as a Fundraising coordinator for a local non-profit called Humans for Education that helps schools in Kenya become financially independent and in turn make sure every child has access to quality education. Now, I have been working as a Workshop Leader for Calculus III and Python. It has been a very rewarding experience because I realized that no matter how much you know about a subject, there is always room to learn more. <a href="http://bchadia.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/csc174/lab1/">Find out more about Chadia.</a></p>
