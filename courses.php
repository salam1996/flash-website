			Along with CSC 174, this semester I’m taking CSC 191/291 (Machines & Consciousness), CSC 242 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence), MUR 168A (West African Drumming Introduction), and PSC 288 (Game Theory).  Some of my favorite courses in the past have been CSC 173 (Computation & Formal Systems), PSC 248 (Discrimination), CSC 170 (Introduction to Web Development), CSC 299W (Social Implications of Computing), and all of the courses required for my cluster in American Sign Language.  I wish I could go back in time, and try out some new courses, or audit more courses I'm interested in but that don't fit my degree requirements.  Some of my favorite courses, such as CSC 170 and PSC 248, started off as interests or curiosity that did not contribute to my degree (not my major, minor, or cluster), but the course either eventually became applicable once I realized it was in line with what I wanted to do or pointed me towards more courses in topics I discovered that I enjoyed.

		<p> I am currently taking a class on Financial Statement Analysis that covers the applied financial analysis and valuation skills that are required to work on Wall Street in, for example, investment banking and equity research firms. The objective of this class is to develop and sharpen one’s analytical ability to use financial information to perform a wide variety of applied economic and financial analysis. Last semester, I took Corporate Finance that I found very interesting. The course examined corporate financing policy – thus our primary focus was on the liability side of the firm’s balance sheet. We examined the valuation of debt and equity claims under the simplifying assumptions made by Modigliani and Miller. We also examined how relaxing those assumptions provides a basis for understanding financing policy choices. We looked at leverage, the use of public vs. private debts, maturity, priority, leasing, and hedging policies. Finally, we also discussed competition and dividend policies.
